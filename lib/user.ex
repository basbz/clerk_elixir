  ## QUERY PARAMETERS

  ### email_address
  Array of strings
  Returns users with the specified email addresses. Accepts up to 100 email addresses. Any email addresses not found are ignored.

  ### phone_number
  Array of strings
  Returns users with the specified phone numbers. Accepts up to 100 phone numbers. Any phone numbers not found are ignored.

  ### external_id
  Array of strings
  Returns users with the specified external ids. For each external id, the + and - can be prepended to the id, which denote whether the respective external id should be included or excluded from the result set. Accepts up to 100 external ids. Any external ids not found are ignored.

  ### username
  Array of strings
  Returns users with the specified usernames. Accepts up to 100 usernames. Any usernames not found are ignored.

  ### web3_wallet
  Array of strings
  Returns users with the specified web3 wallet addresses. Accepts up to 100 web3 wallet addresses. Any web3 wallet addressed not found are ignored.

  ### user_id
  Array of strings
  Returns users with the user ids specified. For each user id, the + and - can be prepended to the id, which denote whether the respective user id should be included or excluded from the result set. Accepts up to 100 user ids. Any user ids not found are ignored.

  ### organization_id
  Array of strings
  Returns users that have memberships to the given organizations. For each organization id, the + and - can be prepended to the id, which denote whether the respective organization should be included or excluded from the result set. Accepts up to 100 organization ids.

  ### query
  string
  Returns users that match the given query. For possible matches, we check the email addresses, phone numbers, usernames, web3 wallets, user ids, first and last names. The query value doesn't need to match the exact value you are looking for, it is capable of partial matches as well.

  ### last_active_at_since
  integer
  Returns users that had session activity since the given date, with day precision. Providing a value with higher precision than day will result in an error. Example: use 1700690400000 to retrieve users that had session activity from 2023-11-23 until the current day.

  Example: last_active_at_since=1700690400000

  ### limit
  number [ 1 .. 500 ]
  Default: 10
  Applies a limit to the number of results returned. Can be used for paginating the results together with offset. Must be an integer greater than zero and less than 500. By default, if not supplied, a limit of 10 is used.

  ### offset
  number >= 0
  Default: 0
  Skip the first offset results when paginating. Needs to be an integer greater or equal to zero. To be used in conjunction with limit.

  ### order_by
  string
  Default: "-created_at"
  Allows to return users in a particular order. At the moment, you can order the returned users by their created_at,updated_at,email_address,web3wallet,first_name,last_name,phone_number,username,last_active_at,last_sign_in_at. In order to specify the direction, you can use the +/- symbols prepended in the property to order by. For example, if you want users to be returned in descending order according to their created_at property, you can use -created_at. If you don't use + or -, then + is implied. We only support one order_by parameter, and if multiple order_by parameters are provided, we will only keep the first one. For example, if you pass order_by=username&order_by=created_at, we will consider only the first order_by parameter, which is username. The created_at parameter will be ignored in this case.

  ### password_digest
  string
  In case you already have the password digests and not the passwords, you can use them for the newly created user via this property. The digests should be generated with one of the supported algorithms. The hashing algorithm can be specified using the password_hasher property.

  ### password_hasher
  string

  ### skip_password_checks
  boolean
  When set to true all password checks are skipped. It is recommended to use this method only when migrating plaintext passwords to Clerk. Upon migration the user base should be prompted to pick stronger password.

  ### skip_password_requirement
  boolean
  When set to true, password is not required anymore when creating the user and can be omitted. This is useful when you are trying to create a user that doesn't have a password, in an instance that is using passwords. Please note that you cannot use this flag if password is the only way for a user to sign into your instance.

  ### totp_secret
  string
  In case TOTP is configured on the instance, you can provide the secret to enable it on the newly created user without the need to reset it. Please note that currently the supported options are:

  Code length: 6 digits
  Algorithm: SHA1

  ### backup_codes
  Array of strings
  If Backup Codes are configured on the instance, you can provide them to enable it on the newly created user without the need to reset them. You must provide the backup codes in plain format or the corresponding bcrypt digest.

  ### public_metadata
